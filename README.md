##subsection title

The functions mean_temperature and get_spreadsheet_columns from previous episode are in there.

We added a main function that is called when you run the script (you could run this python script by calling python analyse_spreadsheet.py on the command line). It will prompt the user for a file name, print the columns in the spreadsheet, and print the mean temperature.
